## Tasks 🛠
Through python, we modified 3 different games to customize them. <br>
<br>
Games used: <br>
- Snake 🐍 <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/marthadelrio">@marthadelrio</a> changed the color of the food, so that it looks like a disco ball<br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/EdgarRostro">@edgarrostro</a> changed the food to 2 different ones that move randomly <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/louloubadillo">@louloubadillo</a> modified the game dynamic (when the snake crashes into a wall it is game over) <br>
- Memory 🧠 <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/marthadelrio">@marthadelrio</a> resized the board (from 8x8 to 4x4) <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/EdgarRostro">@edgarrostro</a> changed the numbers in the tiles to letters and resized the image behind the board<br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/louloubadillo">@louloubadillo</a>  added counters for the final score and total taps of the game and printed them <br>
- Pacman 👾 <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/marthadelrio">@marthadelrio</a> changed the gameboard to a bigger space for roaming <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/EdgarRostro">@edgarrostro</a> adapted the ghosts to move smartly and chase Pacman in a targeted way <br>
  · <a href="https://github.com/louloubadillo">@louloubadillo</a> modified the velocity of the ghosts (made them faster) and decreased de number of ghosts (from 4 to 2) <br>
