## Tasks
Through python, we modified 3 different games to customize them. <br>
<br>
Games used: <br>
- Snake 🐍 <br>
  · Changed the color of the food <br>
  · Changed the food to 2 different ones that move randomly <br>
  · Modified the game dynamic (when the snake crashes into a wall it is game over) <br>
- Memory 🧠 <br>
  · Resized the board (from 8x8 to 4x4) and the size of the image behind it <br>
  · Changed the numbers in the tiles to letters <br>
  · Printed the final score and total taps of the game <br>
- Pacman 👾 <br>
  · Modified the velocity of the ghosts (made them faster) and decreased de number of ghosts (from 4 to 2) <br>
  · Changed the gameboard to a bigger space for roaming <br>
  · Adapted the ghosts to move smartly and chase Pacman in a targeted way <br>
